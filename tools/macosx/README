DESCRIPTION
OS X [darwin] Readme

This README will help you roll your own native OSX, OCSNG.app client for enterprise deployment.

PREREQUISITES

- XCode 6.4
- Darwin Perl dependencies [A tarball with all the PerlDep's you'll need for this to run in darwin-land, see create....cpan.pl script]
- OCSNG.pmproj [Apple PackageMaker binrary settings file]
- Iceberg [http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Iceberg.html]

BUILDING/INSTALLING

- Run the tools/macosx/scripts/create-darwin-perl-lib_fromCPAN.pl script which will create the ~/darwin-perl-lib directory. This directory will stash a built version of all the perl libraries needed to run this client (ie: no running CPAN on the hosts you're deploying this on)
	- READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE RUNNING, some CPAN configurations are needed prior to running
	- You'll need CPAN, Perl (the development libraries for perl), so Xcode Tools (just about a full install).
- Open the tools/macosx/ocsng_app-xcode/OCSNG.xcodeproj project using Xcode 6.4 and build it (Choose menu "Product\Archive")
- Export the created archive to folder tools/macosx/installer_gui/iceberg/
- OPen tools/macosx/installer_gui/iceberg/iceberg_project.packproj file using Iceberg and build it to create the final graphic installer 

COPYRIGHT

See AUTHORS file. Ocsinventory-Agent is released under GNU GPL 2 licence. Portions of the Xcode project may fall under other, open licences (individual files will elaborate). Some of the Xcode project files are not core pieces of OCSNG and are to be treated as a supplement tool for building the agent for OSX deployment.

NOTES

- macosx tools was created by claimid.com/wesyoung and modified by OCS NG team for the 2.0 version.

- Once installed, the agent should contact the server and upload an initial inventory, then go back to sleep.

- OCS MacOSX agent is launched using LaunchD but you can click on /Applications/OCSNG.app to launch OCS agent manually.

- You can take a look to OCS MacOSX logs in /var/logs/ocsng.log file (by default)

- To uninstall the .app, use the uninstaller.sh script in /Application/OCSNG/Contents/Resources directory. This will kill the service, remove all the files (no restart required).

- This package works on MacOSX 10.9+ on i386, ppc and x86_64 architectures.
